## 9.3.0

#### Project

* Bump up the embedded `swctl` version in OAP Docker image.

#### OAP Server

* Add component ID(133) for impala JDBC Java agent plugin and component ID(134) for impala server.
* Use prepareStatement in H2SQLExecutor#getByIDs.(No function change).
* Bump up snakeyaml to 1.32 for fixing CVE.
* Fix `DurationUtils.convertToTimeBucket` missed verify date format.
* Enhance LAL to support converting LogData to DatabaseSlowStatement.
* [**Breaking Change**] Change the LAL script format(Add layer property).
* Adapt ElasticSearch 8.1+, migrate from removed APIs to recommended APIs.
* Support monitoring MySQL slow SQLs.
* Support analyzing cache related spans to provide metrics and slow commands for cache services from client side
* Optimize virtual database, fix dynamic config watcher NPE when default value is null
* Remove physical index existing check and keep template existing check only to avoid meaningless `retry wait`
  in `no-init` mode.
* Make sure instance list ordered in TTL processor to avoid TTL timer never runs.
* Support monitoring PostgreSQL slow SQLs.
* [**Breaking Change**] Support sharding MySQL database instances and tables by [Shardingsphere-Proxy](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/overview/#shardingsphere-proxy).
  SQL-Database requires removing tables `log_tag/segment_tag/zipkin_query` before OAP starts, if bump up from previous releases.
* Fix meter functions `avgHistogram`, `avgHistogramPercentile`, `avgLabeled`, `sumHistogram` having data conflict when
  downsampling.
* Do sorting `readLabeledMetricsValues` result forcedly in case the storage(database) doesn't return data consistent
  with the parameter list.
* Fix the wrong watch semantics in Kubernetes watchers, which causes heavy traffic to API server in some Kubernetes clusters,
  we should use `Get State and Start at Most Recent` semantic instead of `Start at Exact`
  because we don't need the changing history events, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#semantics-for-watch.
* Unify query services and DAOs codes time range condition to `Duration`.
* [**Breaking Change**]: Remove prometheus-fetcher plugin, please use OpenTelemetry to scrape Prometheus metrics and
  set up SkyWalking OpenTelemetry receiver instead.
* BugFix: histogram metrics sent to MAL should be treated as OpenTelemetry style, not Prometheus style:
  ```
  (-infinity, explicit_bounds[i]] for i == 0
  (explicit_bounds[i-1], explicit_bounds[i]] for 0 < i < size(explicit_bounds)
  (explicit_bounds[i-1], +infinity) for i == size(explicit_bounds)
  ```
* Add APISIX metrics monitoring

#### UI

* Fix: tab active incorrectly, when click tab space
* Add impala icon for impala JDBC Java agent plugin.
* (Webapp)Bump up snakeyaml to 1.31 for fixing CVE-2022-25857
* [Breaking Change]: migrate from Spring Web to Armeria, now you should use the environment variable
  name `SW_OAP_ADDRESS`
  to change the OAP backend service addresses, like `SW_OAP_ADDRESS=localhost:12800,localhost:12801`, and use
  environment
  variable `SW_SERVER_PORT` to change the port. Other Spring-related configurations don't take effect anymore.
* Polish the endpoint list graph.
* Fix styles for an adaptive height.
* Fix setting up a new time range after clicking the refresh button.
* Enhance the process topology graph to support dragging nodes.
* UI-template: Fix metrics calculation in `general-service/mesh-service/faas-function` top-list dashboard.
* Update MySQL dashboard to visualize collected slow SQLs.
* Add virtual cache dashboard
* Remove `responseCode` fields of all OAL sources, as well as examples to avoid user's confusion.
* Remove All from the endpoints selector.
* Enhance menu configurations to make it easier to change.
* Update PostgreSQL dashboard to visualize collected slow SQLs.
* Add gateway apisix menu
* Query logs with the specific service ID
* Bump d3-color from 3.0.1 to 3.1.0

#### Documentation

* Add `metadata-uid` setup doc about Kubernetes coordinator in the cluster management.
* Add a doc for adding menus to booster UI.
* Move general good read blogs from `Agent Introduction` to `Academy`.
* Add re-post for blog `Scaling with Apache SkyWalking` in the academy list.
* Add re-post for blog `Diagnose Service Mesh Network Performance with eBPF` in the academy list.
